# dogcam-streamdeck

Streamdeck plugin for controlling the [dogcam](https://github.com/roguedarkjedi/dogcam). Super basic plugin based off [the template](https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck-plugintemplate). Most of the time was spent making the glorious images.

It's not super great, but it's here to get the job done. It could be expanded further, but since the dogcam will be controlled by AI eventually, there's not much of a point to putting in tons of work into this model.

The Elgato Streamdeck API can be [found here](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/overview/). 

Methods of installing can be found [here](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/create-your-own-plugin/) or you can use the binary found in the releases (which may be out of date).
