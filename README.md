# dogcam-streamdeck

Streamdeck plugin for controlling the dogcam. Super basic plugin based off [the template](https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck-plugintemplate). Most of the time was spent making the glorious images.

It's not super great, but it's here to get the job done. It could be expanded further, but since the dogcam will be controlled by AI eventually, there's not much of a point to putting in tons of work into this model.
